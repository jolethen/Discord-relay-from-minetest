# Relay bridge

a simple relay bridge between minetest and discord, made to be compatible with webhooks

# Config example 

Go to mintest.conf and add
```secure.http_mods = discord_relay
discord_webhook = webhook link
if any else mod is also using http use it like secure.http_mods = discord_relay, mod2, mod3```

# Any issues?

Add *jolethen* on discord and i shall respond within 24-48 hours :)
